<h2>1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is about building systems that can perform tasks that require human intelligence. These include reasoning, understanding language, recognizing images, decision-making, and learning.</p>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/0*InwAK5u06D2rXULA">
<p>This field has grown rapidly due to better hardware, large datasets, and advanced algorithms.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Simply put, AI is about creating systems that can reason, learn, perceive, and act to solve problems and achieve goals, often mimicking human cognitive functions.</p>

<h2>2. History of AI</h2>
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240402161005/Evolution-of-AI.png">
<p>AI started with early thinkers like Alan Turing, who asked whether machines can think. The first official AI conference was held in 1956 at Dartmouth College.</p>
<p>The history of AI includes phases like symbolic AI, expert systems, neural networks, and deep learning revolutions.</p>
<p>The concept of thinking machines dates back to antiquity, but the field of AI as we know it was formally founded at the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956. Early years saw great optimism, followed by "AI winters" where funding and interest waned due to unfulfilled promises. The subsequent decades saw the rise of expert systems and breakthroughs in algorithms, ultimately leading to the current boom fueled by vast Datasets and increased computational power.</p>
